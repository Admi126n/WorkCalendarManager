#  Work Calendar Manager

Main purpose of this app is helping with managing my work time. Without this app I had to manually find free time between my college classes. Now I just set proper settings, choose month and app adds work to my calendar.


In app settings I can set:
- Maximum and minimum duration for work
- Work start and end hours
- Margins before and after work
- Calendars which should be ignored while app is searching for free time
